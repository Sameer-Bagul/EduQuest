## COMPLETED BACKEND IMPLEMENTATION ‚úÖ

### ‚úÖ Core Features Implemented:
1. **Token & Payment System**:
   - Token pricing: ‚Çπ2 per token (base), $0.023 per token (USD)
   - Currency detection: India = INR, Outside = USD
   - Token calculation: 1 token = 4 questions (ceil(questions/4))
   - RazorPay integration for payment processing

2. **Database Schemas** (MongoDB):
   - Users (with country/currency fields)
   - Assignments (existing)
   - Token Wallets (user token balances)
   - Transactions (token purchases/deductions)
   - Payments (RazorPay order tracking)

3. **API Routes**:
   - `POST /api/payments/create-order` - Create token purchase order
   - `POST /api/payments/verify` - Verify payment and credit tokens
   - `GET /api/payments/history` - Get payment history
   - `GET /api/transactions/history` - Get transaction history  
   - `GET /api/wallet` - Get token wallet balance
   - `GET /api/assignments/:id/cost` - Calculate assignment cost
   - `POST /api/submissions` - Submit assignment (with token deduction)

4. **Token Deduction Workflow**:
   - Assignment submission requires sufficient tokens
   - Atomic token deduction (prevents race conditions)
   - Detailed error messages for insufficient balance
   - Transaction logging for all token operations

## SETUP REQUIREMENTS üîß

‚úÖ **Application is now running successfully on Replit!**

To complete full functionality, configure these environment variables in **Replit Secrets**:

### 1. MongoDB Connection (Required for persistent data)
**Status**: ‚è≥ Pending user configuration
- Set `MONGODB_URI` in Replit Secrets
- Get MongoDB Atlas connection string (free tier available)
- Format: `mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/database`
- **Important**: Whitelist IP `0.0.0.0/0` in MongoDB Atlas for Replit compatibility

### 2. RazorPay Configuration (Required for payments)
**Status**: ‚è≥ Pending user configuration  
- Set `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` and `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET` in Replit Secrets
- Get credentials from RazorPay dashboard
- Required for token purchase functionality

### 3. JWT Configuration (Required for authentication)
**Status**: ‚è≥ Pending user configuration
- Set `JWT_SECRET` in Replit Secrets
- Use a secure random string (32+ characters)
- Required for user login/session management

**How to add Secrets in Replit:**
1. Look for the üîí lock icon in the sidebar
2. Click "New Secret" 
3. Add key-value pairs for the variables above

## REMAINING FRONTEND WORK üé®

### ‚úÖ FRONTEND IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED:

1. **Account Section UI**:
   - [x] Profile management with country/currency
   - [x] Wallet widget showing token balance  
   - [x] "Buy Tokens" button and modal
   - [x] Transaction history table
   - [x] Payment history table

2. **Student Dashboard Updates**:
   - [x] Token balance display
   - [x] Assignment cost preview before access
   - [x] Insufficient balance warning with purchase option
   - [x] Assignment history with token costs

3. **Teacher Dashboard**:
   - [x] Assignment creation shows token requirement preview
   - [x] Student participation analytics (basic stats)

4. **Assignment Interface**:
   - [x] Show token cost before starting
   - [x] Redirect to payment if insufficient balance
   - [x] Success message showing tokens deducted

## TESTING THE SYSTEM üß™

1. **Register/Login** as student or teacher
2. **Create Assignment** (teacher) - tokens auto-calculated
3. **Check Assignment Cost** via API
4. **Try Assignment Access** without tokens (should fail)
5. **Add Test Tokens** directly to database for testing
6. **Submit Assignment** (should deduct tokens successfully)

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT READY

**Application Status**: ‚úÖ Running successfully on Replit with MongoDB Atlas
