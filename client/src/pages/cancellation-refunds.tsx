                <li>
                  Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made within
                  <strong> Not Applicable</strong> of placing the order. However, the cancellation request

                  the vendors/merchants and they have initiated the process of shipping them.
                </li>

                <li>
                  reportsnmarkets does not accept cancellation
